A Project of [HackYourFuture](https://github.com/HackYourFuture)

This project is a Tip Calculator! Using HTML, CSS (with no Framework), and JavaScript.

A user can fill in 3 things:

* The amount of the bill
* How good the service was
* How many people will share the bill

When the button is clicked a calculation is made and the user can read the tip amount underneath.
